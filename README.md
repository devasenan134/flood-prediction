Problem Statement:

Natural disasters have the potential to cause a major loss of income due to damage to infrastructure, crops, or a decrease in demand and tourism
This loss of income is more significant for those in the low-income category as they have fewer resources to begin the rebuilding process
Machine learning uses technology to track data and identify similarities and patterns that occur prior to an earthquake
